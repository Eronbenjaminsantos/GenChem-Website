          <span>Hydrogen</span> is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1. Hydrogen is the lightest
          element. At standard conditions hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules having the formula H2. It is
          colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical
          substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter. Stars such as the Sun are mainly
          composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. Most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as
          water and organic compounds. For the most common isotope of hydrogen (symbol 1H) each atom has one proton, one
          electron, and no neutrons. <br><br>

          In the early universe, the formation of protons, the nuclei of hydrogen, occurred during the first second
          after the Big Bang. The emergence of neutral hydrogen atoms throughout the universe occurred about 370,000
          years later during the recombination epoch, when the plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to
          protons

            <span>Fluorine</span> is the chemical element with the symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest
            halogen and exists as a highly toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions. As the most
            electronegative element, it is extremely reactive, and it readily forms compounds with most other elements.
            <br><br>
            Fluorine is found in nature primarily in the form of fluoride compounds. It plays a crucial role in dental
            health and is added to toothpaste and drinking water to prevent tooth decay. It is also used in various
            industrial processes, including the production of chemicals, aluminum, and uranium enrichment.
            <br><br>
            Due to its reactivity, handling pure fluorine gas is dangerous and requires specialized equipment. It was
            first isolated in pure form in 1886 by the chemist Henri Moissan, who worked with great difficulty to
            achieve this feat.

      electrons
      and neutrons.
      <br><br>
      The protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of the atom, which is surrounded by the electrons belonging to the
      atom. The atomic number of an element describes the total number of protons in its nucleus.

      Neutral atoms have equal numbers of protons and electrons. However, atoms may gain or lose electrons in order to
      increase their stability, and the resulting charged entity is called an ion.
      <br><br>
      Atoms of different elements have different atomic structures because they contain different numbers of protons
      and
      electrons. This is the reason for the unique characteristics of different elements.

    <div class="contents">Atomic Models</div>
    <div class="meaning">
      The earliest belief about the structure of the atom was attributed to Dalton, who suggested that matter was made
      of tiny indivisible particles called ‘Atoms.’
      <br><br>
      The discovery of electrons proved for the first time that atoms themselves were made of fundamental particles,
      which were the constituents of all atoms and therefore, atoms did have a fine structure that was unique to every
      different atom.
      <br><br>
      Therefore, this discovery of electrons proved that some particles were themselves the fundamental building
      blocks
      of atoms.
      <br><br>
      In the 18th and 19th centuries, many scientists attempted to explain the structure of the
      atom with the help of atomic models. Each of these models had its own merits and demerits and was pivotal to the
      development of the modern atomic model. The most notable contributions to the field were by the scientists such
      as John Dalton, J.J. Thomson, Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr. Their ideas on the structure of the atom are
      discussed in this subsection.

    <div class="contents">Solid Sphere Model - Dalton’s Atomic Theory</div>
    <div class="meaning">The English chemist John Dalton suggested that all matter is made up of atoms, which were
      indivisible and indestructible. He also stated that all the atoms of an element were exactly the same, but the
      atoms of different elements differ in size and mass.
      <br><br>

      Chemical reactions, according to Dalton’s atomic theory, involve a rearrangement of atoms to form products.
      According to the postulates proposed by Dalton, the atomic structure comprises atoms, the smallest particle
      responsible for the chemical reactions to occur.
      <br><br>

      <span>The following are the postulates of his theory:</span> <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Every matter is made up of atoms.</li>
        <li>Atoms are indivisible.</li>
        <li>Specific elements have only one type of atom in them.</li>
        <li>Each atom has its own constant mass that varies from element to element.</li>
        <li>Atoms undergo rearrangement during a chemical reaction.</li>
        <li>Atoms can neither be created nor destroyed but can be transformed from one form to another.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <span>Dalton’s atomic theory </span><br><br>
      successfully explained the Laws of chemical reactions, namely, the Law of conservation of mass, the Law of
      constant properties, the Law of multiple proportions and the Law of reciprocal proportions.
      <br><br>

      <span>Demerits of Dalton’s Atomic Theory </span><br><br>
      The theory was unable to explain the existence of isotopes.
      Nothing about the structure of the atom was appropriately explained.
      Later, scientists discovered particles inside the atom that proved the atoms are divisible.
      The discovery of particles inside atoms led to a better understanding of chemical species; these particles
      inside
      the atoms are called subatomic particles. The discovery of various subatomic particles is as follows:

      Nuclear Model - Rutherford Atomic Model
    </div>
    <div class="meaning">
      Rutherford Atomic Model – The plum pudding model given by J. J. Thomson failed to explain certain experimental
      results associated with the atomic structure of elements. Ernest Rutherford, a British scientist conducted an
      experiment and based on the observations of this experiment, he explained the atomic structure of elements and
      proposed Rutherford’s Atomic Model.
      Rutherford’s Alpha Scattering Experiment
      Rutherford conducted an experiment by bombarding a thin sheet of gold with α-particles and then studied the
      trajectory of these particles after their interaction with the gold foil.
      <br><br>

      <span>Rutherford Atomic Model and Limitations</span>
      <br><br>
      Rutherford, in his experiment, directed high energy streams of α-particles from a radioactive source at a thin
      sheet (100 nm thickness) of gold. In order to study the deflection caused to the α-particles, he placed a
      fluorescent zinc sulphide screen around the thin gold foil. Rutherford made certain observations that
      contradicted
      Thomson’s atomic model.
      <br><br>
      <span>Observations of Rutherford’s Alpha Scattering Experiment</span><br><br>
      The observations made by Rutherford led him to conclude that:
      <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>A major fraction of the α-particles bombarded towards the gold sheet passed through the sheet without any
          deflection, and hence most of the space in an atom is empty.</li>
        <li>Some of the α-particles were deflected by the gold sheet by very small angles, and hence the positive
          charge
          in an
          atom is not uniformly distributed. The positive charge in an atom is concentrated in a very small volume.
        </li>
        <li>Very few of the α-particles were deflected back, that is only a few α-particles had nearly 180o angle of
          deflection. So the volume occupied by the positively charged particles in an atom is very small as compared
          to
          the
          total volume of an atom.</li><br><br>
        <span> Rutherford Atomic Model</span>
      </ul><br><br>
      Based on the above observations and conclusions, Rutherford proposed the atomic structure of elements. According
      to the Rutherford atomic model:
      <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>The positive charge and most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in an extremely small volume. He
          called
          this
          region of the atom as a nucleus.</li>
        <li>Rutherford’s model proposed that the negatively charged electrons surround the nucleus of an atom. He also
          claimed
          that the electrons surrounding the nucleus revolve around it with very high speed in circular paths. He
          named
          these circular paths as orbits.</li>
        <li>Electrons being negatively charged and nucleus being a densely concentrated mass of positively charged
          particles
          are held together by a strong electrostatic force of attraction
        <li>
      </ul>
      <br><br>
      <span>Limitations of Rutherford Atomic Model</span><br><br>
      Although the Rutherford atomic model was based on experimental observations, it failed to explain certain
      things.
      <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Rutherford proposed that the electrons revolve around the nucleus in fixed paths called orbits. According
          to
          Maxwell, accelerated charged particles emit electromagnetic radiations and hence an electron revolving
          around
          the
          nucleus should emit electromagnetic radiation. This radiation would carry energy from the motion of the
          electron
          which would come at the cost of shrinking of orbits. Ultimately the electrons would collapse in the nucleus.
          Calculations have shown that as per the Rutherford model, an electron would collapse into the nucleus in
          less
          than
          10-8 seconds. So the Rutherford model was not in accordance with Maxwell’s theory and could not explain the
          stability of an atom.</li>
        <li>One of the drawbacks of the Rutherford model was also that he did not say anything about the arrangement
          of
          electrons in an atom which made his theory incomplete.</li>
        <li>Although the early atomic models were inaccurate and failed to explain certain experimental results, they
          formed
          the base for future developments in the world of quantum mechanics</li>

      <span>Atomic Structure of Isotopes</span><br><br>
      Nucleons are the components of the nucleus of an atom. A nucleon can either be a proton or a neutron. Each
      element
      has a unique number of protons in it, which is described by its unique atomic number. However, several atomic
      structures of an element can exist, which differ in the total number of nucleons.
      <br><br>
      These variants of elements having a different nucleon number (also known as the mass number) are called isotopes
      of the element. Therefore, the isotopes of an element have the same number of protons but differ in the number
      of
      neutrons.
      <br><br>
      The atomic structure of an isotope is described with the help of the chemical symbol of the element, the atomic
      number of the element and the mass number of the isotope. For example, there exist three known naturally
      occurring
      isotopes of hydrogen, namely, protium, deuterium and tritium. The atomic structures of these hydrogen isotopes
      are
      illustrated below.

      Planetary Model - Bohr Model
    </div>
    <div class="meaning">
      Niels Bohr proposed the Bohr Model of the Atom in 1915. Because the Bohr Model is a modification of the earlier
      Rutherford Model, some people call Bohr's Model the Rutherford-Bohr Model. The modern model of the atom is based
      on
      quantum mechanics. The Bohr Model contains some errors, but it is important because it describes most of the
      accepted features of atomic theory without all of the high-level math of the modern version. Unlike earlier
      models,
      the Bohr Model explains the Rydberg formula for the spectral emission lines of atomic hydrogen.
      <br><br>
      The Bohr Model is a planetary model in which the negatively charged electrons orbit a small, positively charged
      nucleus similar to the planets orbiting the sun (except that the orbits are not planar). The gravitational force
      of
      the solar system is mathematically akin to the Coulomb (electrical) force between the positively charged nucleus
      and
      the negatively charged electrons.

      <span>Main Points of the Bohr Model</span>
      <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Electrons orbit the nucleus in orbits that have a set size and energy.</li>
        <li>The energy of the orbit is related to its size. The lowest energy is found in the smallest orbit.</li>
        <li>Radiation is absorbed or emitted when an electron moves from one orbit to another.</li>

      Quantum Mechanical Atomic Model - Schrödinger Model
    </div>
    <div class="meaning">
      In 1926, Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger (1887-1961) used the wave-particle duality of the electron to
      develop and solve a complex mathematical equation that accurately described the behavior of the electron in a
      hydrogen atom. The quantum mechanical model of the atom comes from the solution to Schrödinger's equation.
      Quantization of electron energies is a requirement in order to solve the equation. This is unlike the Bohr
      model,
      in which quantization was simply assumed with no mathematical basis.

      <br><br>
      Recall that in the Bohr model, the exact path of the electron was restricted to very well-defined circular
      orbits
      around the nucleus. The quantum mechanical model is a radical departure from that. Solutions to the Schrödinger
      wave equation, called wave functions, give only the probability of finding an electron at a given point around
      the
      nucleus. Electrons do not travel around the nucleus in simple circular orbits.

      <br><br>
      The location of the electrons in the quantum mechanical model of the atom is often referred to as an electron
      cloud. The electron cloud can be thought of in the following way: Imagine placing a square piece of paper on the
      floor with a dot in the circle representing the nucleus. Now take a marker and drop it onto the paper
      repeatedly,
      making small marks at each point the marker hits. If you drop the marker many, many times, the overall pattern
      of
      dots will be roughly circular. If you aim toward the center reasonably well, there will be more dots near the
      nucleus and progressively fewer dots as you move away from it. Each dot represents a location where the electron
      could be at any given moment. Because of the uncertainty principle, there is no way to know exactly where the
      electron is. An electron cloud has variable densities: a high density where the electron is most likely to be
      and
      a low density where the electron is least likely to be (see below).
      <br><br>
      In order to specifically define the shape of the cloud, it is customary to refer to the area within which there
      is
      a 90
      chance of finding the electron. This is called an orbital, the three-dimensional region of space that indicates
      where there is a high probability of finding an electron.
